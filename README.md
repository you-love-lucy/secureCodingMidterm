## secureCodingMidterm

# Overview

This app takes a file or string as input, encrypts it, decrypts it, and verifies the integrity via hash comparison.

# CIA Triad

This app upholds the CIA triad by keeping the encrypted file confidential, checking the integrity of the file with hashing, and making the decrypted file avaliable to the user at the end.

# Entropy and Key Generation

Entropy (randomness) guarantees the encrypted file cannot be decrypted without the key, keeping it secure.
